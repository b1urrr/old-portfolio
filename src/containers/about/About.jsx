            <p>I've always been passionate about computers and technology. In my early teens I was crazy about gaming, later on I studied Computer Science in high school. I started dabbling in graphic design which landed me my first job as a Prepress Specialist. After that I dove in the world of networking and started my second job as a Telecommunications Technician. I then went back for a 5 year stint in design and prepress as a Desktop Publishing Operator, 2 of which in a Team Lead role</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I was always keen on learning to code, but it seemed so boring at first. Boy, was I wrong! I pushed myself into buying a course on Udemy, made a small research and decided on Python. Its easy syntax and wide range of applications were the selling point for me. I studied in pretty much all of my free time. It felt damn good to be able to manipulate the computer to your needs, not gonna lie.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Then was the disappointment. Most python developers are working with data, numbers crunching and analytics. I'm not interested in that. Where to now? I have some back-end experience - a front-end technology it is. After all I have a pretty solid design foundation. I bought another course on Udemy, this time Web Development. Same teacher, same concepts, different technology. Long story short - I devoured the course in less than a month.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Now I'm working on building a solid portfolio and putting all of my newly acquired skills and passion to use in a new position. <br></br><br></br>Stay tuned for updates! ðŸ˜Ž</p>
